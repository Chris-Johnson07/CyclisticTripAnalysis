# CyclisticTripAnalysis

This repository showcases what I've learned while completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This project serves as the capstone upon completing the certificate courses. It is a data anaylsis project for a hypothetical company in which I am presented a question from the "Marketing Director" to answer using the given data sets. I then demonstrate my proficiency in data cleaning, preparing, manipulating, analysis, and visualisation before preparing a presentation for my findings. The markdown file is the presentation for this project.
